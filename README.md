Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

# My personal opinions on version control 

What I like about version control is that it makes it easy to track changes in code especially when in collabortive team.

What I find frustrating is that resolving merge conflicts can be time  consuming and frustrating when multiple people are working on the same file
